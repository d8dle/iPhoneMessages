View and Export messages from iPhone backups

It's a free but not (yet) an open source application.
This repository is used to track issues.
If you have any issue using the application, or want to request a new feature, feel free to submit it via the "Issues" section of this repository.

The binary can be downloaded from the releases section.

Usage
-----
1. Use iTunes to make a unencrypted backup of your iPhone.
2. Download the binary and extract it to any folder.
3. Run the application.

I created this application for my own usage. I only tested it with iTunes 12 and iPhone 7 with IOS 15. 
Please let me know if you find it not working with other versions of iTunes or IOS.
